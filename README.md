# Strands Agent Chatbot with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore

An end-to-end reference architecture for building **agentic workflows** using  
**Strands Agents** and **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore**.

This repository demonstrates how to design and deploy a multi-agent chatbot that combines
tool execution, memory, browser automation, and agent-to-agent collaboration.
It is intended as a realistic, extensible sample for teams exploring advanced agent architectures on AWS.

**Scenarios covered in the demo:**

| Scenario | Tools | What it does |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| **Personal AI Agent** | Notion, Gmail, Google Maps, Google Calendar | Check to-dos, find emails, get directions, set reminders |
| **Financial Research** | Finance, Google Search, Deep Research | Analyze crypto price history, summarize market news, compare bear markets |
| **Document Generation** | Presentation, Code Interpreter | Build an executive deck with charts from research results |
| **Autonomous Browsing** | Amazon Nova Act, AgentCore Browser | Search Google Flights and extract results |

---

## What this repository demonstrates

- Multi-agent orchestration with **Strands Agents**
- Integration with **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore**
- Tool-enabled agents (search, finance, weather, browser, code interpreter)
- Autonomous browser, documentation, and analysis workflows
- Modular architecture adaptable to real customer use cases
- Infrastructure-as-Code (CDK) for repeatable deployment

If you are building **agentic AI applications on AWS** and want a concrete, end-to-end example,
this repository is designed to be read, run, and extended.

## Overview

This sample combines **Strands Agent orchestration** with **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore services**:

- **Strands Agents** – Multi-turn reasoning and tool orchestration  
- **AgentCore Runtime** – Managed, containerized agent execution  
- **AgentCore Memory** – Persistent conversation state and summarization  
- **AgentCore Gateway** – MCP-based tool integration with SigV4 authentication  
- **AgentCore Code Interpreter** – Secure execution for analysis and document generation  
- **AgentCore Browser** – Headless browser automation with live view  
- **Amazon Nova Act** – Visual reasoning model for browser automation  

---

## Architecture Overview

The system is composed of the following layers:

- **Frontend / UI** – User interaction  
- **Backend (BFF)** – Request routing and streaming  
- **AgentCore Runtime** – Agent execution  
- **AgentCore Gateway** – Tool access  
- **Strands Agents** – Multi-agent coordination  
- **Tools & Memory** – External APIs and state  

This design emphasizes **extensibility, observability, and clear separation of concerns**.

## Key Features

- Strands-based agent orchestration
- Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, Gateway, and Memory
- MCP Gateway tools (Google, Wikipedia, ArXiv, Yahoo Finance, Tavily, Open-Meteo)
- Agent-to-Agent (A2A) collaboration
- Built-in Code Interpreter for charts and documents
- Multimodal input and output (vision, charts, documents, screenshots)
- Real-time voice interaction with Amazon Nova Sonic 2  

---

## Use Cases

- Financial research agents  
- Technical research assistants using multi-agent patterns  
- Autonomous web automation agents  
- Memory-backed conversational assistants  
- Hybrid research workflows using MCP, A2A, and AWS SDK tools  

---

## Voice Mode

Real-time voice interaction using **Amazon Nova Sonic 2**, **Strands BidiAgent**,
and **AgentCore Runtime WebSocket**.

- Seamless switching between voice and text within a single session
- Shared conversation history across both modes
- Full tool execution support during voice conversations

---

## Multi-Agent Architecture

This sample demonstrates a **Supervisor–Worker multi-agent pattern** using the
**Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol**.

## Multi-Protocol Tool Architecture

| Tool Category | Protocol | Examples | Authentication |
|--------------|----------|----------|----------------|
| Local Tools | Direct Python | Web Search, URL Fetcher, Visualization | None |
| Built-in Tools | AWS SDK / WebSocket | Code Interpreter, Browser (Nova Act) | IAM |
| Gateway Tools | MCP | Google Search, Maps, Wikipedia, ArXiv, Finance | SigV4 |
| A2A Tools | A2A | Research Agent, Browser-Use Agent | SigV4 |

Total: **80+ tools across 18 tool groups**
See [docs/guides/TOOLS.md](docs/guides/TOOLS.md) for full details.

## Dynamic Tool Filtering

     alt="Tool Filtering Flow"
     width="900">

Only user-selected tools are included in each model invocation,
reducing prompt size and execution cost.

---

## Memory Architecture and Long-Context Management

The system uses **AgentCore Memory** with:
- Short-term session memory
- Long-term summarized memory

Long conversations are compacted using a context summarization strategy to
retain key information while controlling token growth.

---

## Token Optimization via Prompt Caching

Prompt caching is implemented via Strands hooks to reuse:
- System prompts
- Stable instruction blocks
- Repeated conversation context

This reduces input token usage while preserving agent behavior.
